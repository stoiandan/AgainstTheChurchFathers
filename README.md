# Introduction
The [Church Fathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Fathers), a series of influential Christian thinkers, theologians and philosohpers. They are often unfold into different categories, such as the period they lived in, hence the name the _Apostolic Fathers_ (those who lived in the earliest Christian times, near or together with the Apostles), like Clement of Rome, Papias and Polycarp, other categories are based on their origin (which influenced their culture, language, philosophy, etc.) like _Greek Fathers_ or _Latin Fathers_.
Their writing are influential on the way Christianity, Christian dogma and history developed, they often proivde text hermeneutics, discuss doctrines and correct heresies and also provided bodies of Church Law (or not dependieng on the particular individual).
Some of my favorites include:
- Augustine of Hippo
- Tertulian (though not officially reocgnized as a Church Father, his writings are as influentatial)
- [Epiphanius, Bishop of Cyprus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphanius_of_Salamis)
- St. Gregory of Nyssa

# Against them?
The idea of this repository is **not** to punch in the face Chruch Fathers, per see, but more a punch in the face against a certain _attitude_, very much pressent in some churchers, especially Eastern-Orrhodox and Roman-Catholic, on an view that Chuech Fathers are almosr infallible individuals.
I essence, this rerepistory is a collection of proofs, that like us (while unlike us, more brilliant and shinning) Church Fathers are not God incarnate, and often err, say stupid things, even dagaming things. They were individuals with a limited knowledge of both God and science, much was yet to be uncovered in that area, and also under the influence of their own cultural idiosicracies (I know we all are, but we are not all views as almost infallible).



## Plain Wrong
No one is always right, we all makes mistakes, and while this is **not** meant to _throw rocks_ and not even to _discredite_ individuals, it is meant to prove they are **wrong at times**:

- [Irenaues (bishop) of Lyion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irenaeus), ammong the early Church Fathers (130 – c. 202 AD). He judges based on _John 8:57_ ("“You are not yet fifty years old,” they said to him, “and you have seen Abraham!”" NIV), that, in essence, because the Jews are saying, "_not yet fifty years", and not, _not yet forty years_, that Christ must have been 40+ years old  during his ministry, close to 50 years. He makes this point in [Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 3)](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103303.htm). He essentially does this in order to prove that Christ saved _all people_, by the virtue of him (Jesus) goign trough all ages, Irenaus argues, that Jesus was a baby, a young man ('till his 30s and that as well), but then also an old men, which would mean 40+ years. Irenaues lived in the second centruy and was a follower of Polycarp, who himself was, supposedly (we know this from Irenaues, not from Polycarp himself) a follower of the Apostles John.
[Some](http://www.biblicalcatholic.com/apologetics/a38.htm) Roman-Catholic apologists are claiming that really doesn't say that. I've read the article and frankly, it just seems to me to twist the words of the text. Thinking to make a video on it.

## Plain Wicked 
We all do wrong and _daily sin_ Romans 3:13, and in political quarrels, Church Fathers have crossed the line at times:

- [John Chrysostom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chrysostom), Capadocian Father and regarder a Great Father, in the Eastern-Orthodox Church, has written a series of homilies angaist a Judaizing faction in the Church of his time. However, in his homilies, John crosses the line, and his cermons would later cause damange and deaths of individuals and would even serve as [Nazi proaganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversus_Judaeos#Chrysostom's_homilies_and_Nazism) in the 20-th century.
These sermons are called [Adversus Judaeos (Against the Jews)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversus_Judaeos),

# Introduction
The [Church Fathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Fathers), are series of influential Christian thinkers, writers, theologians and philosohpers. They are often unfold into different categories, for example, by the _period_ they lived in, hence the name the _Apostolic Fathers_ (those who lived in the earliest Christian times, near or together with the Apostles), like [Clement of Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Clement_I), [Papias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papias_of_Hierapolis) and [Polycarp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycarp), other categories are based on _origin_ (which influenced their culture, language, philosophy, etc.) like _Greek Fathers_ or _Latin Fathers_.
Their writing are influential on the way Christianity, Christian dogma and history developed, they often proivde textual hermeneutics, discuss doctrines, correct heresies and at times provided bodies of Church Law.
Some of my favorites include:
- [Augustine of Hippo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo)
- [Tertulian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertullian) (though not officially reocgnized as a Church Father, his writings are as influentatial)
- [Epiphanius, Bishop of Cyprus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphanius_of_Salamis)
- [St. Gregory of Nyssa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_of_Nyssa)

# Against them?
The idea of this repository is **not** to punch Chruch Fathers in the face, but more of a punch in the face against a certain _attitude_, very much pressent in some churches, especially Eastern-Orrhodox and Roman-Catholic, on an view that Church Fathers are almost infallible. Where their writing ar treated with much reverence, and a _false image_ of a so called _universal consensus of the fathers_, is invoked. For example the phrase _as the fathers teach_, often being by Eastern-Orthodox saints, alluding to the fact that _everyone_, _everywhere_, since all times has believed this or that.  
In essence, this rerepistory is a collection of _proofs_, that like us (while unlike us, more brilliant and shinning) Church Fathers are not God incarnate, and often err, say stupid things, even dagaming things. They were individuals with a limited knowledge of both God and science, much was yet to be uncovered in that area, and also under the influence of their own cultural idiosicracies (I know we all are, but we are not all views as almost infallible).



# Plain Wrong
No one is always right, we all makes mistakes, and while this is **not** meant to _throw rocks_, not even to _discredite_ individuals, it is meant to prove they are **wrong at times**:

## Irenaues says Jesus was 40+ years old
[Irenaues (bishop) of Lyion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irenaeus), ammong the early Church Fathers (130 – c. 202 AD). He judges based on _John 8:57_ ("“You are not yet fifty years old,” they said to him, “and you have seen Abraham!”" NIV), that, because the Jews are saying, "_not yet fifty years_", as opposed to, _not yet forty years_, Christ must have been 40+ years old  during his ministry, close to 50 years. He makes this point in [Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 3)](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103303.htm). He essentially does this in order to prove that Christ saved _all people_, by the virtue of him (Jesus) going trough all ages. Irenaus argues, that Jesus was a baby, a boy, a young man ('till his 30s, included) and then also an _old men_, which would mean 40+ years by that standard.

Irenaues lived in the second centruy and was a follower of Polycarp, who himself was, supposedly (knowing from Irenaues, not from Polycarp himself) a follower of the _Apostles John_.
[Some](http://www.biblicalcatholic.com/apologetics/a38.htm) Roman-Catholic apologists are claiming that he _doesn't really_ say that. I've read the article and frankly, it just seems to me to twist the words of the original text. Thinking to make a video on it.

# Plain Wicked 
We all do wrong and _daily sin_ Romans 3:13, and in political quarrels, Church Fathers have crossed the line at times:

## John Chrysostom spreads hate towards the Jews
[John Chrysostom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chrysostom), Capadocian Father and regardet as a [_Great Father_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Fathers#Great_Fathers) in the Eastern-Orthodox Church. He has written a series of homilies angaist a judaizing faction of the Church of his time. However, in his homilies, John crosses the line, and his sermons would later cause damange and harm (even kill?) people. His sermons would even serve as [Nazi proaganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversus_Judaeos#Chrysostom's_homilies_and_Nazism) in the 20-th century.
These sermons are called [Adversus Judaeos (Against the Jews)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversus_Judaeos), and can be found [here](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Eight_Homilies_Against_the_Jews). St. John delievers not _one_, not _two_, but _eight_, such homilies, and just to cite something from his first homily:
>Another prophet hinted at this when he said: "Israel is as obstinate as a stubborn heifer". And still another called the Jews "an untamed calf".
(6) Although such beasts are unfit for work, they are fit for killing. And this is what happened to the Jews: while they were making themselves unfit for work, they grew fit for slaughter. This is why Christ said: "But as for these my enemies, who did not want me to be king over them, bring them here and slay them". [Luke 19:27] You Jews should have fasted then, when drunkenness was doing those terrible things to you, when your gluttony was giving birth to your ungodliness—­not now. Now your fasting is untimely and an abomination. Who said so? Isaiah himself when he called 
>

and in part IV (total use of the word 'Jews' is 279):

>Indeed the synagogue is less deserving of honor than any inn. It is not merely a lodging place for robbers and cheats but also for demons. This is true not only of the synagogues but also of the souls of the Jews, as I shall try to prove at the end of my homily

In defence of St. John, Eastern-Orthodox standard apologetical replay is that _St. John was merley using an oratorical techinique_ common to his time called _psogos_, in which it was common to skip all quailties of one's adversary and only talk about his down sides.
I don't see how this exonerates St. John, after all, one could say that _Frank_ was a _maffia boss_, during a _hard time_, when it was more common to engage in _maffia activity_, does that make it right?
Even so, the responose is trying to make the criticism look stupid, because it denotes ignorance of Byzantine culture. Well my point is that Byzantine culture is irelevnat in this context, the _deffinition_ of _psogos_ is:
> (rhetoric) A speech that attempts to insult, degrade, or otherwise attack something​. 

So ok, we didn't knew it existed and we didn't knew it was common. The question still remains, how does that makes things better?
Again, it's like saying it's _anachronistic_ to say slavery is _evil_, because it was common during a period. It makes no difference, and you'd expect a bit more from one that would eventually be called, and I kid you not, _golden mouthed_.

# Church Fathers and councils contradict each other
You might be familiar with the idea that there were [seven ecumenical councils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_seven_ecumenical_councils). The first council, was invoked by [Emperor Constantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great), after granditing Christians religious liberty by the [Edict of Milan in 313](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Milan), Constaintine's ambitions were probably to have a unified Christianity in order to have it a state Church. Something that Theodosius managed to do by the [Edict of Thessalonica in 380](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_church_of_the_Roman_Empire).
So, in order to have unity, Constatine convoked a council of Bishops at Nicea, in 325 AD, the first ecumenical council, meant to settle the Christological question of _Who was Christ?_.

## Were Ecumenical Councils universally accepeted?
Troughout time, there were seven such councils and they are called _ecumenical_, because _supposedly_, they where accepted by the [Great Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Church), the _whole Church_. So everything was _pink_, until Catholics and Orthodox split off in 1054 at the [Great Schism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East%E2%80%93West_Schism). Or was it?
First of all, something that throughout _12 years of religious education in school was never mentioned to me_, is that this is _false_.
The third ecumenical [council, of Ephesus, in 431](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Ephesus), saw a schism in the Church, between Christian churches of Sassanid Persia, which affiliated with Nestorius, and the Roman Church.
The next eccumenical council, the fourht eccumenical [Council of Chalcedon, in 451](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Chalcedon), just 20 years after, brought yet another schism, this time more major, beteewn what we call today [Oriental Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental_Orthodox_Churches), or Coptic Orthodox, or Oriental Orthodoxy  - again mostly churches outside the _Roman Empire_, like the [Syriac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syriac_Christianity), Ethiophian, Armenian Churches - and the Roman State Church.

### What is an Ecumenical Council after all?
The frist council at Nicea, was convoked by Emperor Constaine, to settle religious problems. Troughout time, there were many other, smaller _local councils_, convoked by _bishops_, and these greater ones. But during a period of time when the Byzantine Empire was in decline, Emperor Leo III, _called_ for another such _ecumenical council_ at [Hiera, in 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Hieria). This was supposed to be the _actual (first) seventh ecumenical council_, where Leo's  convictions, namely that the empire was in decline because people started to venerate _icons_ - which he saw as graven imagies - were to be uphold and _icons_, condemned as _heretical_.
So the _council_ took place, _icons_ were condemned as graven images, and a total period of ~100 years followed where _iconoclams (Greek for destroyer of icons)_ was the norm and orthodoxy in the Byzantine Empire (Rome rejected this council and never accepted it as eccumenical, much like the _Oriental_ and _Nestorian Church_ did with the third and fourth councils).

Another eccumenical council followed in Nicea, the [Second Council of Nicea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Council_of_Nicaea), where the _(first seventh) council of Hiera_, was condemned and is today no longer recognized as eccumenical council.

A simmilar incident happened, where again the Eastern-Orthodox Church, _reuinited_ with the Roman-Catholic Church in 1431, at the [Council of Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Florence) - supposed to be an eccumenical council - only so that the Orthodox may later _deny it_, and simply not follow with the council's conclusions.  

But all this just **beggs** the question, _what is an ecumenical council after all?_

## What happened to St. Mary?
The Christian Gospels do not mention what happened to St. Mary, the mother of Jesus, after the cruxifixion when Jesus entrusts her to St. John, and after she is mentioned a couple more times in the Gospels.

Certain traditions and roumers started to come out, including in [gnostic literature](https://christiantruth.com/articles/articles-roman-catholicism/assumption/). In essence, Epiphanius, c. 310–320 – 403, who was born in Judea, says the he know of three stories that are in circulation as to what happened to her:
1. She was killed
2. She died and was burried
3. She remained alive

Epiphanius is a _sincere man_, addresses these claims and plainly states that:

> But if some think us mistaken, let them search the Scriptures. They will not find Mary’s death; they will not find whether she died or did not die; they will not find whether she was buried or was not buried … Scripture is absolutely silent [on the end of Mary] …
>> Epiphanius, Panarion, Haer. 78.10-11, 23. Cited by juniper Carol, O.F.M. ed., Mariology, Vol. II (Milwaukee: Bruce, 1957), pp. 139-40).

But then later on, comes [John of Damascus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Damascus), c. 675 or 676, and plainly _ignores_ Epiphanius, boldly claims the [dormition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assumption_of_Mary#History), and... that's it folks!

Well not quite, even as of today, the Roman-Catholic and Eastern-Ortohdox understanding of _what happened_, simply [differes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assumption_of_Mary#Assumption_versus_Dormition). In my opinion, this just proves how tradition is not _relible_, how there is no _consensus_, since what one person, who came earlier and _lived_ in a better suited place said _Scripture is silent on this matter_, then comes one who is regarded as _authoritative_ and by that virtue hes _decrees_ are keept in _high esteem_.

# Theology based on political reasons

Theology is composed of ideas, doctrines, philosophy, etc. Ideas are in no way without consequences, if you believe that the color red at a semaphore means you're free to walk, you're going to have a hard time. This section I want to explore how some ideas where present in the Christian world, even promoted by saints and powerful figures, who one one hand propoents of Orthodoxy tell us we must obey and listen to as if they where Chist himself. On the other hand, Church Fathers themselves ignor another and eve akwardly reject another, in silence, promoting the exact opposite of another, in order to fit their political agenda.

## John Damascene's rejection of Christian mortalism

### An introduction to mortalism and the eternal soul
We must fisrt begin by introducting the concept of [Christian Mortalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_mortalism), in essence, this simply states that the human soul, is **not** imortal. This has it's roots in ancient Judaism, where we see all sorts of proofs for this:
- "_The dead do not praise the Lord, nor do any who go down into silence._" Psalm 115:17;
- " And the dust returns to the earth as it was, and _the spirit returns to God who gave it_." Ecclesiastes 12:7;
- " Behold, all souls are mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is mine: the soul who sins shall die. " Ezekiel 18:4.

This is also visible in the New Testament as well:
- " Behold! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed," 1 Corinthians 15:51; 
- " For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." Romans 6:23;

In essence, Judaism took the idea of an _ eternal soul_, from other cultures, Greeks, Babylonians, Zoroastrianism, etc. It was [Alexander the Great (356 BC - 323 BC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great), who konquered _everything_ around the _mediterranean sea_, bringing Greek, academia and _helenizing_  the suroundings.
The effects of this where vastly visibile, long after Alexander brought the Greek influence, we see people who where higly influential like Philo of Alexandria(20 BCE- 50 CE), modeling how we understand Scripture based on ideas like [natural law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law) and [stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism) (see [Dr. Christine Hayes ](https://youtu.be/4zBRLu_cNtc?t=1451)).

These ideas are visible in books like Daniel and thogether with Jewish apoclypticism,furhter developed in the inter-testamental period, or the second temple period.

### John Damascene's agenda.

Geting back to our story, [Syiriac Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syriac_Christianity) had a number of saints advocating for mortalism.
The earliest unambiguous instance of Christian mortalism is found in Tatian's Address to the Greeks from the second half of the second century. Tatian writes: "The soul is not in itself immortal... If, indeed, it knows not the truth, it dies, and is dissolved with the body, but rises again at last at the end of the world with the body, receiving death by punishment in immortality. But, again, if it acquires the knowledge of God, it dies not, although for a time it be dissolved." (taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_mortalism#Second_to_eighth_centuries), original [source](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/tatian-address.html))

_Tatian_ had his disciples, and one them that came _close_ to this was [Athenagoras of Athens (133 - 190)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenagoras_of_Athens), a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church. However, John Damascene's theology of _icon veneration_, if you think about it, it's stricly related to the doctrine of _prayer to the saints_. Why?

Well, when you pray to the icon of a saint, what would be the purpose of that "_window to Heaven_", as icons are called, if the saint at the window is not actually there, but he's sleeping in the grave, awaiting resurection, as St. Paul says:
"And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost" 1 Corinthians 15:17-18
So _John Damascene_, born c. 675 or 676, doesn't want to listen to "the saints", because mortalism will trash his icon and prayer to the saints theology, but instead, becomes himself a leading figure, vehemently respected in today's Orthodoxy.

# Introduction
The Church Fathers, a series of influential Christian thinkers, theologians, philosohpers, etc. They are often unfold into different categories, such as the Apostolic Church Fathers, like Clement of Rome, Papias, Polycarp, etc.

Some of my favorites include:
- Augustine of Hippo
- Tertulian
- Epiphanius, Bishop of Cyprus
- St. Gregory of Nyssa

# Against them?
The idea of this repository is not so much a punch in the face against Chruch Fathers, per see, but more a punch in the face against a certain attitude, very much pressent in some Churchers, especially Eastern-Orrhodox and Roman-Catholic, on an almost infailability of these individuals.
I essence, this rerepistory is a collection of proofs, that like us, and while unlike us, more brilliant and shinning, Church Fathers are not God incarnate, and often err, say stupid things, even dagaming things.

# Introduction
The [Church Fathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Fathers), are series of influential Christian thinkers, writers, theologians and philosohpers. They are often unfold into different categories, for example, by the _period_ they lived in, hence the name the _Apostolic Fathers_ (those who lived in the earliest Christian times, near or together with the Apostles), like [Clement of Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Clement_I), [Papias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papias_of_Hierapolis) and [Polycarp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycarp), other categories are based on _origin_ (which influenced their culture, language, philosophy, etc.) like _Greek Fathers_ or _Latin Fathers_.
Their writing are influential on the way Christianity, Christian dogma and history developed, they often proivde textual hermeneutics, discuss doctrines, correct heresies and at times provided bodies of Church Law.
Some of my favorites include:
- [Augustine of Hippo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo)
- [Tertulian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertullian) (though not officially reocgnized as a Church Father, his writings are as influentatial)
- [Epiphanius, Bishop of Cyprus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphanius_of_Salamis)
- [St. Gregory of Nyssa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_of_Nyssa)

# Against them?
The idea of this repository is **not** to punch Chruch Fathers in the face, but more of a punch in the face against a certain _attitude_, very much pressent in some churches, especially Eastern-Orrhodox and Roman-Catholic, on an view that Church Fathers are almost infallible. Where their writing ar treated with much reverence, and a _false image_ of a so called _universal consensus of the fathers_, is invoked. For example the phrase _as the fathers teach_, often being by Eastern-Orthodox saints, alluding to the fact that _everyone_, _everywhere_, since all times has believed this or that.  
In essence, this rerepistory is a collection of _proofs_, that like us (while unlike us, more brilliant and shinning) Church Fathers are not God incarnate, and often err, say stupid things, even dagaming things. They were individuals with a limited knowledge of both God and science, much was yet to be uncovered in that area, and also under the influence of their own cultural idiosicracies (I know we all are, but we are not all views as almost infallible).



## Plain Wrong
No one is always right, we all makes mistakes, and while this is **not** meant to _throw rocks_, not even to _discredite_ individuals, it is meant to prove they are **wrong at times**:

### Irenaues says Jesus was 40+ years old
[Irenaues (bishop) of Lyion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irenaeus), ammong the early Church Fathers (130 – c. 202 AD). He judges based on _John 8:57_ ("“You are not yet fifty years old,” they said to him, “and you have seen Abraham!”" NIV), that, because the Jews are saying, "_not yet fifty years_", as opposed to, _not yet forty years_, Christ must have been 40+ years old  during his ministry, close to 50 years. He makes this point in [Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 3)](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103303.htm). He essentially does this in order to prove that Christ saved _all people_, by the virtue of him (Jesus) going trough all ages. Irenaus argues, that Jesus was a baby, a boy, a young man ('till his 30s, included) and then also an _old men_, which would mean 40+ years by that standard.

Irenaues lived in the second centruy and was a follower of Polycarp, who himself was, supposedly (knowing from Irenaues, not from Polycarp himself) a follower of the _Apostles John_.
[Some](http://www.biblicalcatholic.com/apologetics/a38.htm) Roman-Catholic apologists are claiming that he_ doesn't really_ say that. I've read the article and frankly, it just seems to me to twist the words of the original text. Thinking to make a video on it.

## Plain Wicked 
We all do wrong and _daily sin_ Romans 3:13, and in political quarrels, Church Fathers have crossed the line at times:

### John Chrysostom spreads hate towards the Jews
[John Chrysostom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chrysostom), Capadocian Father and regardet as a [_Great Father_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Fathers#Great_Fathers), in the Eastern-Orthodox Church, has written a series of homilies angaist a judaizing faction of the Church of his time. However, in his homilies, John crosses the line, and his sermons would later cause damange and harm (even kill?) people. His sermons would even serve as [Nazi proaganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversus_Judaeos#Chrysostom's_homilies_and_Nazism) in the 20-th century.
These sermons are called [Adversus Judaeos (Against the Jews)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversus_Judaeos), and can be found [here](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Eight_Homilies_Against_the_Jews). St. John delievers not _one_, not _two_, but _eight_, such homilies, and just to cite something from his first homily:
>Another prophet hinted at this when he said: "Israel is as obstinate as a stubborn heifer". And still another called the Jews "an untamed calf".
(6) Although such beasts are unfit for work, they are fit for killing. And this is what happened to the Jews: while they were making themselves unfit for work, they grew fit for slaughter. This is why Christ said: "But as for these my enemies, who did not want me to be king over them, bring them here and slay them". [Luke 19:27] You Jews should have fasted then, when drunkenness was doing those terrible things to you, when your gluttony was giving birth to your ungodliness—­not now. Now your fasting is untimely and an abomination. Who said so? Isaiah himself when he called

In defence of St. John, Eastern-Orthodox standard apologetical replay is that _St. John was merley using a oratorical techinique_ common to his time called _psogos_, in which it was common to skip all quailties of one's adversary and only talk about his down sides.
I don't see how this exonerates St. John, after all, _Frank Sintara_ was a _maffia boss_, during a _hard time_, when it was more common to engage in _maffia activity_.
Even so, the responose is trying to make the criticism look stupid, because it denotes ignorance of Byzantine culture. Well my point is that Byzantine culture is irelevnat in this context, the _deffinition_ of _psogos_ is:
> (rhetoric) A speech that attempts to insult, degrade, or otherwise attack something​. 

So ok, we didn't knew it existed and we didn't knew it was common. The question still remains, how does that makes things better?
Again, it's like saying it's _anachronistic_ to say slavery is _evil_, because it was common during a period. It makes no difference, and you'd expect a bit more from one that would eventually be called, and I kid you not, _golden mouthed_.

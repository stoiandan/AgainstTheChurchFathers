# Introduction
The [Church Fathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Fathers), a series of influential Christian thinkers, theologians and philosohpers. They are often unfold into different categories, such as the period they lived in, hence the name the _Apostolic Fathers_ (those who lived in the earliest Christian times, near or together with the Apostles), like Clement of Rome, Papias and Polycarp, other categories are based on their origin (which influenced their culture, language, philosophy, etc.) like _Greek Fathers_ or _Latin Fathers_.
Their writing are influential on the way Christianity, Christian dogma and history developed, they often proivde text hermeneutics, discuss doctrines and correct heresies and also provided bodies of Church Law (or not dependieng on the particular individual).
Some of my favorites include:
- Augustine of Hippo
- Tertulian (though not officially reocgnized as a Church Father, his writings as influentatial)
- [Epiphanius, Bishop of Cyprus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphanius_of_Salamis)
- St. Gregory of Nyssa

# Against them?
The idea of this repository is not so much to punch in the face Chruch Fathers, per see, but more a punch in the face against a certain attitude, very much pressent in some Churchers, especially Eastern-Orrhodox and Roman-Catholic, on an almost infailability of these individuals.
I essence, this rerepistory is a collection of proofs, that like us, and while unlike us, more brilliant and shinning, Church Fathers are not God incarnate, and often err, say stupid things, even dagaming things.



## Plain Wrong
- [Irenaues (bishop) of Lyion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irenaeus), ammong the early Church Fathers. He judges based on _John 8:57_ ("“You are not yet fifty years old,” they said to him, “and you have seen Abraham!”" NIV), that, in essence, because the Jews are saying, "_not yet fifty years", and not, _not yet forty years_, that Christ must have been 40+ years old  during his ministry, close to 50 years. He makes this point int [Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 3)](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103303.htm). He essentially does this in order to prove that Christ saved _all people_, by the virtue of him (Jesus) goign trough all ages, Irenaus argues, that Jesus was a baby, a young man ('till his 30s and that as well), but then also an old men, which would mean 40+ years. Irenaues lived in the second centruy, 130 – c. 202 AD and was a follower of Polycarp, who himself was, supposedly (we know this from Irenaues, not from Polycarp himself) a follower of the Apostles John.
[Some](http://www.biblicalcatholic.com/apologetics/a38.htm) Roman-Catholic apologists are claiming that really doesn't say that. I've read the article and frankly, it just seems to me to twist the words of the text. Thinking to make a video on it.
